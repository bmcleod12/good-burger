## Walkthrough

To use this application, you can visit the deployed Heroku version here: https://frozen-hollows-62628.herokuapp.com/ or download the files from the repo.

1. Upon opening the application, you will be presented with a log of burgers: some marked to be devoured; some already devoured:

2. Use the green checkmark to check burgers off the To be Devoured list and add them to the Already Devoured list:

3. Use the Add a new Burger form to enter a burger you would like to track:

## Future Enhancements

For future app enhancements, it would be nice to allow notes to be entered about each burger so you can remember where the burger was ordered and how you felt about it.  The UI also needs some work to become mobile-friendly so allowing the two lists to resize themselves is another item for a future release.
